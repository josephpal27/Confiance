Public relations are extremely important for any brand to truly blossom – any great idea needs execution, and a major part of the execution is to convey the right messages to the clientele. The right PR person helps doing just that – showcasing the brand in the right way, and Conficnace did not only just that – but much more. They truly understood the ethos of our brand, what our philosophy was and what, as a brand, we wanted to stand out for, and convey to the audience. They were always asking the right questions and bringing in fresh and creative ideas from their end. Bushra was also always ready to have brainstorming sessions to aid us, and bring out better execution from our ideas, and to contribute her own. She was extremely dedicated to highlighting the brand’s presence, just the way we had envisioned it to be. It was certainly a great pleasure working with them.",
